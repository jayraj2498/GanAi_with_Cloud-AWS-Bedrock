GEnai proj lifecycle LLMops (genai on cloud) 


step 1 : Defining the usecase 

- it can be Rag application , text summerization , Chatbot , baed on diff - diff usecase 


step 2 : choosing the right model 

A) - wheather you are usign --> "foundation model" and solve usecase 
    foundation model is opanai , llama2 , gemini , clody , mistral 

    most of the  generic use cases you can use those kind of foundation model and solve usecase 

    - in foundation model we solve usecase AND on top of it if we want tht our model behave well on custom data
    we do "finetunning" by using (llora , Qloora )


B) - wheather you want to build your own "custom LLM "

    custom LLM Building LLM model from crash  



After selecting Right Kind of Model their main 3 task you need to follow :

    1) U can use Prompt enginnering and solve usecase 
    2) finetunning  
    3) Training with Human feedback  

    Evaluate the model: 
    after applying all the above step then we have to " Evaluate " the model tht how is your model Performing 
    by usign diff diff performance matrix step  


    so , combine this step our model is ready  





step 3 : Deployment & further integration diff diff applicaion 

    step A) 

    optimize and deploye models   <<- this deployement is done for infrencing 
    & here is where LLMops is used 

    - here we use diff diff tech --> ex   Groq 

    - here we use all services AWS , GCP , AZURE  


    step B ) 

    In application Integration we build LLM powerd application 
    and solve diff diff usecases
